      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>I am currently living In Tallahassee, Florida working on future ideas for buisnesses I would like to help prosper. Helping others has always been a passion of mine and making sure the work is perfect. </p>

      <p>I have grossed over 40 thousand followers in about two months on the popular phone app TikTok for helping others learn about growing aquatic plants. </p>

      <p>Since I was 12 I knew I had always wanted to be a creator, my goal moving forward would be to create web developed sites for myself and others to help and grow local buisness and make those life long dreams come true.</p>
